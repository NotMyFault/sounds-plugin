<div>
Enter the path to the archive containing your sounds.<p />
This path should either be a local filing system path (file:), a classpath (classpath:), or an absolute http(s): URL accessible from the Jenkins server.
Jenkins streams the audio from the archive for each event (to reduce memory requirements), so make sure it's not too far away.<p/>
The default value is:<br />
<pre>    classpath:sound-archive.zip</pre>
The archive can be of .zip or .jar format. Jenkins ignores the folder structure of the archive, so avoid adding sounds of the same name.
